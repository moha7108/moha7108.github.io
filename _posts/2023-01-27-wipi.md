 A Raspberry Pi (RPI) based Wi-Fi Bridge for routing clients to internet connection through a RPI router. It is used as a Wi-Fi repeater, or to give access to internet connections with enterprise WPA security protocol for lower level electronics such as Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollers and IOT devices. Users may also want to use this as an easy-to-use interface for accessing RPI through local networks over SSH after first time installation, without having a monitor and keyboard setup or configuring settings pre-installation with RPI imager.

### Materials
- Raspberry Pi<sup>\**</sup>
- Wi-Fi Dongle​<sup>\**</sup>
- Micro SD Card​
- Power Supply​<sup>\***</sup>
- Case (Optional)

<sub><sup><sup>\**</sup> Check list of [compatible devices](#compatible-devices)</sup></sub>,
<sub><sup><sup>\***</sup> 5V 3A supply recommended</sup></sub>

### Installation Instructions
1. The RPi OS image file can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfivoJRY1-tfTbqO5MyLWXaK64weQToH/view?usp=share_link).
1. You can install the image file onto a microSD card using the [RPi Imager application](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
1. Once the image file has been copied to the microSD card, instert the card into the RPi, plug in the wifi-dongle into the USB port of the RPi, and then boot the device.
1. Done, the WI-PI bridge should be working! Check your network wifi connections for the SSID [wipi_bridge]

### Connecting to the WI-PI bridge dashboard
#### Access without network connection(First time Connecting):​

1. Connect client to Access Point (default: wipi_bridge, psk: adamchuk)​
1. On web browser go to: *10.0.1.1:1880/​* or *wipi-bridge.local:1880/* (mdns option)
1. [Configure settings](#configuration-network-connection)

#### Accessing through connected network connection

1. On web browser go to: *wipi-bridge.local:1880/* (mdns option) or *x.x.x.x:1880/* (x.x.x.x is the network IP of the WI-PI Brigdge assigned by the router)​

### Interface:

The Wipi bridge can be accessed by browser following the [instructions](#connecting-to-the-wi-pi-bridge-dashboard) above

#### (WLAN1) Network Connection
This section displays the information of the connected network that we are trying to bridge to our clients. The information displayed includes the SSID of the host network, The IP Address of the bridge within the host network, and finally the Netmask and Broadcast of the host network. If the information does not display, this means that the wipi bridge is not connected to any host network.

#### (WLAN0) Access Point
This section displays the information of the bridge connection which serves as an access point for the device. This section is configurable, and the SSID and PSK of the access point can be changed. Default congiuration is *SSID: wipi_bridge, PSK: adamchuk*.

#### Configuration Network Connection
This section allows you to connect to a host network via WLAN1. The scan button manually queries available network detected nearby. You must select the security type such as WPA or WPA-enterprise and input the security information corresponding to the security time. Click update when all information is entered. The RPI will restart and automatically connect you to the host network. Now the Access point (WLAN0) will act as a bridge to the host network.
