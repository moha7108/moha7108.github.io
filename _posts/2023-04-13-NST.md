**Topic:** Stylistic Music Video Through Neural Matting and Style Transfer

**Abstract** — Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a framework that
represents a 3D scene in the weights of a fully connected
neural network, known as the Multi-Layer Perception(MLP). The
method was introduced for the task of novel view synthesis and
is able to achieve state-of-the-art photorealistic image renderings
from a given continuous viewpoint. NeRFs have become a popular
field of research as recent developments have been made that
expand the performance and capabilities of the base framework.
Recent developments include methods that require less images
to train the model for view synthesis as well as methods that are
able to generate views from unconstrained and dynamic scene
representations.
